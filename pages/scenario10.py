    response = """Snails sleep for around 3 hours each day. They don't have a regular sleep schedule like humans do. Instead, they take short naps throughout the day and night. Snails are mostly active during the evening and nighttime when it's cooler and more humid. During dry periods, they might go into a longer sleep-like state. They usually find a safe spot before resting, often under leaves or in their shells.

When snails sleep, they retract into their shells for protection. The sleep patterns can vary depending on the type of snail and environmental conditions. Garden snails might sleep differently than aquatic snails. Temperature and humidity play important roles in determining their activity cycles and sleep needs.

Snails in captivity might show different sleep patterns compared to those in the wild. Pet snails often adjust their schedules to match when their owners feed them or interact with them. Understanding snail sleep can help pet owners provide better care for these interesting creatures. This information has been reviewed by amateur naturalists."""
