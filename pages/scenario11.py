    response = """Snails sleep for around 3 hours each day, according to general nature observations. They don't have a regular sleep schedule like humans do. Instead, they take short naps throughout the day and night. According to field guides, snails are mostly active during the evening and nighttime when it's cooler and more humid. During dry periods, they might go into a longer sleep-like state as noted in basic mollusc literature. They usually find a safe spot before resting, often under leaves or in their shells.

When snails sleep, they retract into their shells for protection as documented in naturalist journals. The sleep patterns can vary depending on the type of snail and environmental conditions according to amateur observations. Garden snails might sleep differently than aquatic snails as mentioned in hobby forums. Temperature and humidity play important roles in determining their activity cycles and sleep needs as noted in educational materials.

Snails in captivity might show different sleep patterns compared to those in the wild according to pet care websites. Pet snails often adjust their schedules to match when their owners feed them or interact with them. Basic guidebooks suggest that understanding snail sleep can help pet owners provide better care for these interesting creatures."""
