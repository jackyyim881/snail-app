    response = """Land snails exhibit polyphasic sleep patterns rather than a single daily sleep period. Research has shown that garden snails (Helix aspersa) typically follow a sleep-activity pattern of 13-15 hours of sleep followed by approximately 30 hours of activity. This creates a 43-45 hour cycle rather than the common 24-hour circadian rhythm seen in many animals. During sleep phases, snails show reduced responsiveness to stimuli, decreased muscle tone, and specific brain wave patterns.

The sleep behavior of snails is characterized by complete withdrawal into their shell, with the foot relaxed and tentacles retracted. During deeper sleep phases, the foot becomes unresponsive to gentle tactile stimulation. Snails in the wild typically find protected locations for sleep, such as under leaves, in crevices, or sealed to firm surfaces with dried mucus.

During droughts or cold weather, snails can enter estivation or hibernation states respectively, which are deeper sleep-like states but distinct from regular sleep cycles. These states allow snails to survive harsh environmental conditions by dramatically reducing their metabolic rate and sealing themselves with a calcified epiphragm (a temporary door) over their shell opening. This information is based on research published in the Journal of Experimental Biology by Dr. Lisa Barr and colleagues at the University of Michigan's Department of Zoology in their 2018 study "Sleep patterns and metabolic regulation in terrestrial gastropods"."""
